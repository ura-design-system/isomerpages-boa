As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA is launching a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

To kickstart the series, we have invited one of our young architects, Ar. Rudy Taslim of Genesis Architects, to understand how the small medium enterprises are coping during this trying time.  

Registered architects who are interested to sign up for the webinar are required to complete the [online registration form]( https://forms.gle/WKpD4ncqsKXVRvNg6).

* Limited to 100 participants for each session. 
* Registration is on a first-come-first-serve basis.
