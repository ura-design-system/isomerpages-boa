As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Wu Huei Siang of WASAA Architects & Associates. Huei Siang is an architect trained in Singapore and Netherlands, who grew up in a family of woodworkers. He is a recipient of multiple scholarships such as the distinguished DesignSingapore Scholarship in his earlier days of training. He has also worked for renowned firms such as DP Architects & SCDA in his professional career. In his pursuit of architecture, Huei Siang seeks to design beautiful spaces with natural light and meaningful architecture that embody qualities of simplicity, repose and delight. 

Under his lead, WASAA Architects & Associates as a boutique practice has gone on to materialize projects such as pedagogical landscapes, landed houses, creative showcases and conservation shophouses, etc. The upcoming projects include a skate park in Jurong Lake Gardens, urban rooftop farm nestled in the heartlands, and a luxury villa in Indonesia.
