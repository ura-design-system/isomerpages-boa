### **BOA Circular: Update on Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Requirements for the year 2021**

With the gradual relaxation of restrictions on events as our nation moves toward Phase 3 of the Circuit Breaker, we would like to update our architects on the revised continuing professional development (CPD) requirements for the year 2021.

**CPD Requirements for Year 2021**

In April 2020, BOA announced a one-off special waiver of the CPD requirements for the year 2020 to help the fraternity tide over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As part of our continued efforts to support our architects in this difficult time, we would like to announce that the CPD requirements will be halved in the year 2021. Please refer to the table below for more information.

**Allocation of CPD points for courses & seminars**

The waiver of CPD points and courses will be extended to 30 Jun 2021. However, to encourage the architects to continue to upgrade themselves and keep up to date with the regulatory requirements, BOA will work with the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) to award CPD points only for selected core courses to be held in the first half of 2021, i.e. from 1 Jan 2021 to 30 Jun 2021. 
 
These core courses include those organized by the building regulatory bodies such as the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) regarding regulatory changes which have an impact on practice. 

We will also continue to work with SIA to resume the accreditation of all courses (both core and non-core courses) in the second half of 2021, i.e. from 1 Jul 2021 onwards. 

We strongly encourage all architects to continue to attend CPD courses and seminars to upgrade themselves and gain valuable knowledge to help them cope with the changes in the workplaces and industry brought about by the pandemic.


Yours sincerely

**AR. NG LYE HOCK, LARRY**

**REGISTRAR**
