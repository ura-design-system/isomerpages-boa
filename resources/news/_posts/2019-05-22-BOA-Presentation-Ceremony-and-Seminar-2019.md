### **BOA Presentation Ceremony & Seminar 2019, 31 Aug 2019**

The Board of Architects (BOA) will be holding its annual Seminar in conjunction with the 2019 Certificate Presentation Ceremony on 31 Aug 19 (Sat) at 7.40 am at the Grand Ballroom, Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, 392 Havelock Road, Singapore 169663.

The BOA Presentation Ceremony is an annual event where the architectural fraternity gather to witness the conferment of Registration Certificates to our newly registered architects, and to get updates on issues pertinent to the profession and the industry locally and internationally.  

The Registrar of BOA will be updating the architectural fraternity on current issues affecting the industry including  learning points derived from disciplinary cases, illegal practices and issues concerning registration and the code of conduct and professional ethics.

This year we have lined up two prominent architects to speak at the Seminar. 

Mr. **Ole Scheeren** is a German-born architect and the principal of Büro Ole Scheeren. His landmark projects shape the way we interact with our cities and generate new social narratives in highly integrative environments. His projects have won numerous awards, including World Building of the Year 2015 and the CTBUH Urban Habitat Award 2014 for The Interlace in Singapore, as well as the global CTBUH Best Tall Building Award 2013 for the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing.

Ar. **Siew Man Kok** co-founded and built MKPL Architects into a firm, highly regarded for its design creativity. The firm garnered several awards including the RIBA Internal Award for Design Excellence for their Kent Vale Faculty Housing and the coveted President’s Design Award for the same project.  He was also the winner of the President’s Design Award for the Designer of the Year in 2015.  

In line with our government’s move to recognise and honour our Pioneer and Merdeka Generation, the Board has also invited 12 pioneer architects to share their contribution in shaping the landscape of Singapore to what she is today – a distinctive global city. This will be an interactive session with the audience and it will be moderated by the Registrar of the Board.  

As seats for the seminar are limited, you are encouraged to register for the Seminar before **8 Aug 2019**. To register, please complete the registration form and return it to BOA together with your payment of **$60/- (BOA Registered Architects)/$120/- (non-registered)**.
