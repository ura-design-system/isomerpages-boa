As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Phua Hong Wei of WOHA Architects Pte Ltd. Hong Wei joined WOHA upon graduation from National University of Singapore in 2006. He was featured in URA’s ’20 Under 45’ Architect in 2017.

With keen interest in community and greenery integration, he brings focus on social and environmental sustainability into his projects. Complementing his professional work, Hong Wei is a Green Mark Accredited Professional and Universal Design Assessor, and currently serves on advisory committees at NParks and National Library Board. In this session, Hong Wei shares his **WO**rk **HA**ppy experience in his journey of crafting houses to hotels, villages to hubs.
