“Singaporean architects have produced a remarkable portfolio of innovative designs, pioneering what might be termed tropical urbanism approach to modern architecture in the context of monsoon Asia…ideas manifested in the new wave of practices are much more comprehensive in response to local social, operational, climatic as well as urban conditions and they have added new values of thought and enriched the pool of contemporary architectural language,” notes professor and architect Li Xiaodong in the new book, Contemporaneous Architecture, now out. 

Contemporary architecture in Singapore has not only created social, sustainable and delightful spaces but has adapted to an evolving environment, offering a new kind of tropical urbanism while creating possibilities for the future and adding to national identity.
