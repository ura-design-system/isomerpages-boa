As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Michael Leong of SAA Architects Pte Ltd. Michael is a Director at SAA, a leading full-service architecture practice headquartered in Singapore. An architect who strongly believes in placing the needs of people and the community at the heart of his designs, Michael has been involved in many of SAA’s key projects ranging from mixed-use developments, master plans, transportation and commercial projects, to healthcare, residential and institutional developments. Currently he leads the design for the Woodlands Health Campus (WHC) project, which will be one of Singapore’s biggest healthcare facilities when completed. In this dialogue, he will be sharing on the firm’s philosophy of Urbanistic, Humanistic, Optimistic.
