![CAC Logo](/images/CAC_Logo.jpg)

The Collaborative Alliance Conference (CAC) is a continuation of the previous Joint BOA-ACES Conferences in 2017 and 2018. The inauguration of this new conference reflects accurately the aspiration of collaboration. Seven organisations have come together for this effort.

Board of Architects (BOA), Professional Engineers Board (PEB), Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore (ACES), Institution of Engineers Singapore (IES), Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (REDAS),
Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL), and Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) .

This year's seminar will be held on 1 Oct 19 (Tue), 9.00 am, at the Heliconia Room, Level 3, Sands Expo & Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956.

The theme for the 2019 Conference is **”Future Economy: Towards a more enterprising and pro-business transformation”**.

The built environment sector value chain is one of the most extensive in the Singapore economy. The sector contributes significantly to the positive transformation of the physical landscape and the socio-economic development of the nation. It also contributes significantly to the well-being of our community. The launch of the Industry Transformation Maps comes with initiatives for deepening partnerships between the private and public sectors. There are also calls for greater integration across the various sectors in the industry. Integration will bring about synergies, with hopes to shift mind-sets towards organizing resources. In turn, the quality of jobs will be elevated, and people will be upskilled. Innovation and internationalization will help us to remain competitive in the future global economy.

Discussion Theme:

1. Enterprising & Innovative Economy;
2. Progressive Business; and
3. Internationalisation.

This annual conference is designed to gather the build environment fraternity, as well as its various stakeholders in the value chain together, to debate, share and exchange views on the challenges and growth prospects of the built environment sector.
